Project Option 1: Object Identification App (Needs image processing)

Description: You need to develop an Android app that will identify objects in a photo
(taken using mobile phone), particularly fruits such as apple, orange, grape, etc. You can assume that a photo 
contains only a single type of fruit or different types of fruits together (in a plate).
